				<p>In this page, you can read a satire essay, made by yours truly. It will tackle how people commonly use the social medias and their 
				addiction to it. It mocks a lot of people so better be ready because you might notice that you are also one of the people I’m talking 
				about in the essay. But at the same time, you might enjoy reading it because of the irony used between the statements and a little bit 
				of exaggeration at some point.</p>
				<p>I hope that you will have fun reading it!</p>
