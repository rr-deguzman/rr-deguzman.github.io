			<h2>&#35;CancelSocialMedias</h2>
					
				<p>First and foremost, I did not write this just to get attention that I want and be famous. This topic that I will discuss 
				is really a serious problem because it feels like we are only living inside the social media, especially in our case right now 
				since we can’t have a face to face interactions. Questions like “Why do we need to solve this problem?” and “What could be the 
				best solution?” would be answered here. I just want to express my opinion regarding these things and let everyone know that we 
				should stop being toxic online so sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms would be very much appreciated!</p>
					
				<p>Now, why do I have to write this? Like what I’ve said in the previous paragraph, I wanted to express my opinion about the toxicity 
				of using the internet. Let me tell a few points here.</p>
					
				<p>My first point is how people are being a bandwagon. Just because this certain thing is trending doesn’t mean that you also need 
				to go with that. Don’t judge other people immediately! Don’t let the other’s opinion affect yours. It ReaLLy HuRtS u KnOw, to be 
				judged by other people who doesn’t even know what really happened. OOMF, that I recently interacted with, told me how they hate this 
				certain person because that person just keeps on going with the trend. That OOMF and I immediately became close because of that. I 
				definitely agree with her! I haven’t seen the person that OOMF told me but I can already feel the bandwagon vibes.</p>
				
				<p>Oh, and another thing, type PROPERLY pls! Stop being a jejemon. Don’t make it hard for the other people to read your message. My 
				head really hurts every time I’m reading those jeje texts. C’mon people, it’s 2020 already! Don’t be such a boomer.</p>
					
				<p>Another thing is people are always trying hard to speak in English just to look cool. They’re grammar isn’t even correct. And they 
				don’t even know the proper use of you’re and your. It’s literally the stupidest and idiotest thing that I encountered here in social 
				medias. You really think that you look cool and all when in fact it’s just became worser. </p>
					
				<p>DON’T POST ABOUT OTHER’S LIFE, RESPECT THEIR PRIVACY! One of friends’ reputation here in social media got wrecked because she keeps 
				on telling embarrassing stories of a certain influencer. That influencer gained some bashers and when they found out that my friend is 
				spreading that kind of stories, they immediately planned a revenge. And then voila! My friend’s life is now ruined. So, lesson learned, 
				okay? Don’t be like my friend because words can really spread faster here in social media platforms. And I’m also wondering, why do 
				the influencers able to affect people’s opinion easily? What’s so special about them when all they do is to gain attentions LOL.</p>
					
				<p>Some might say that I am just OA but no, I AM NOT! I only want to spread awareness regarding these things and propose a solution. 
				So why not just cancel social medias? If we cancel them, then people would not be able to do ridiculous things and spread toxicity. 
				Those social media addicts would be able to sleep now and fix their health and lives. The mental health of those depressed people 
				(because they can’t keep up with the trend nor gain any followers) would be fine now. And by doing this, we could also solve the 
				problem for cyber bullying, right?</p>
					
				<p>Cyber bullying is one of the most common social issue in our country. According to Philippine Statistics, among the 1,268 children
				(7 to 12 years old) and 1,143 teenagers (13 to 16 years old), 80% and 30% were bullied through the internet (FROM HUMILIATION TO THREATS: 
				Survey says 80% of young teens in PHL experience cyberbullying, 2015). Typical cases were through humiliation, threatening, photo 
				editing, spreading videos, and attacks on appearance. And according to another data, 57% of the victims are female while 43% are males 
				(The Culture of Cyberbullying in the Philippines | The ASK Project, 2020). Females are usually sexually harassed through social medias 
				by the means of pornography. So, if social medias did not exist, then the cases such as feminism would also lessen in number.</p>
					
				<p>If only we are using the social medias to make everyone aware of the social issues that our country (and also the other countries 
				in the world) is facing right now, then that would definitely be better. Why do we need to post so many unnecessary things when we 
				could post something that can add to our knowledge? Instead of letting us know how your house maid and your driver are having a coitus, 
				then why not post something that would spread awareness about sex education. But no, we chose to continuously judge other people on 
				social medias because of just a little bit of mistake. We chose to drag other people down by using the sharp words of social medias. 
				We are clearly not thinking before we post something about a certain topic. Why do we even have a brain if we’re not going to use it, 
				right? If being ignorant of the truth, closing our minds for other people’s struggles, and judging others with baseless opinions are 
				a profession or a job that can make a money for living, then a lot of people including those in the government will shower in gold.</p>
					
				<p>Anyways, my proposal is a very intelligent move to lessen the problems of our society. If you are still opposing because you can’t 
				live without social medias, then just go on and die. Well, at least you can contribute to lessen the overpopulation problem of the world. 
				On the other hand, if you have read this carefully, then you should have understood my point.  So, could you please kindly share this 
				and let’s post altogether with the #CancelSocialMedias. That’s all, peace out!</p>
